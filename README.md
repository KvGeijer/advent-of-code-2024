# Advent of Code 2024

This repo contains my code for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024). This year I'll write most of my initial solutions in [Zote](https://github.com/KvGeijer/zote), but I will also try to write visualizations, for which I will likely use Python and its plethora of languages.
