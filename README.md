# Advent of Code 2024

This repo contains my code for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024). This year I'll write most of my initial solutions in [Zote](https://github.com/KvGeijer/zote), but I will also try to write visualizations (seen below), for which I will likely use Python and its plethora of libraries.

## Visualizations
I've also set up a Youtube playlist with all these videos, as well as with some additional notes on them here: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnxtTYEiiNNKM7xZ438_dU-3GrPvtf8cd](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnxtTYEiiNNKM7xZ438_dU-3GrPvtf8cd)
